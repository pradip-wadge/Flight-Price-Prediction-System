## Project Overview
Flight prices can vary significantly depending on multiple factors such as time of booking, route, carrier, and more. This system leverages machine learning techniques and data analytics to create a web application that predicts flight prices based on user inputs.

The core objectives of this project include:
- Collecting and cleaning flight data for analysis.
- Implementing a predictive machine learning model.
- Creating a user-friendly interface using Flask.

## Features
- **Flight data analysis and visualization**
- **Predictive model for flight prices**
- **Interactive user input for customized predictions**
- **Responsive web interface built with Flask**

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Flask (for web development)
  - Scikit-learn (for building the machine learning model)
  - Pandas and NumPy (for data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
- **Deployment**: Flask server and integration with other deployment platforms (e.g., Heroku or AWS)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd flight-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Enter the required details for predicting flight prices.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to get the estimated flight price.
